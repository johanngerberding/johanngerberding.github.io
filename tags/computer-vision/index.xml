<p align="justify">
In the previous <a href="https://johanngerberding.github.io/johannsblog/Object-Detection-From-R-CNN-to-Mask-RCNN">post</a> we have reviewed region-based object detection algorithms (R-CNN models). In the following post I will dive a bit deeper into fast one-stage detection models like YOLO and RetinaNet which are more suited for certain applications with real-time requirements. The models I'm going to talk about here are a bit outdated and don't necessarily correspond to the state-of-the-art in this area anymore. Nevertheless, I find the general development in this area very interesting and the algorithms presented here form the basis for the current state-of-the-art. At that time, two-stage detectors were usually ahead of single-stage detectors in terms of accuracy, which is no longer the case today. In my next post I will go into more detail about state-of-the-art models such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09070.pdf">EfficientDet</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10934.pdf">YOLOv4</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="yolo">YOLO</h2>
<p align="justify">
As mentioned before, two stage detection models like Faster R-CNN are region based and considered to slow for certain applications that require real-time capabilities, e.g. in the robotics area or autonomous driving. So let's start with YOLO ("You Only Look Once") which was one of the first approaches to building a fast real-time object detector. Instead of relying on region proposals the authors reframed the object detection as a single regression problem, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the images (therefore the name).
</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p align="justify">
This makes the whole system (Figure 1) fairly simple (single ConvNet) and very fast (45 fps). Since the model uses features from the entire image to predict the boxes it reasons globally.
</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p align="justify">
The input image gets divided into an $S \times S$ grid, where each grid cell predicts $B$ bounding boxes and confidence scores ($S=7$,  $B=2$). If the center of an object falls into a grid cell than this grid cell is "responsible" for the detection. Each bounding box consists of 5 predictions: <i>x_center</i>, <i>y_center</i>, <i>width</i>, <i>height</i> and <i>confidence</i>. The x and y coordinates are relative to the bounds of a grid cell. The width and height are relative to the image. So all predicted values are between 0 and 1. In addition each grid cell also predicts $C$ class probabilities which are conditional on the grid cell containing an object (for PascalVOC: $C=20$). These values encode the probabilities of that class appearing in the box and how well the predicted box fits the object. One of the main limitations of this approach is the fact that each grid cell can only contain one object (max: 49 objects per image).
</p>
<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p align="justify">
Now let's talk about training the YOLO model. First the convolutional layers get pretrained on ImageNet for a week with an image input size of 224x224. Thereafter to finetune the network on the detection task, four convolutional layers and two fully connected layers get added and the image size is increased to 448x448. As activation LeakyReLU is applied. The loss function is Sum-Squared Error (SSE) consisting of two parts: localization and classification loss:
</p>
<p>$$
L_{loc} = \lambda_{coord} \sum_{i=0}^{S^{2}} \sum_{j=0}^{B} \mathbb{1}_{ij}^{obj} [(x_{i} - \hat{x}_{i})^{2} + (y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i})^{2} + (\sqrt{w_{i}} - \sqrt{\hat{w}_{i}})^{2} + (\sqrt{h_{i}} - \sqrt{\hat{h}_{i}})^{2}]
$$</p>
<p>$$
L_{cls} = \sum_{i=0}^{S^{2}} \sum_{j=0}^{B} (\mathbb{1}_{ij}^{obj} \lambda_{noobj}(1 - \mathbb{1}_{ij}^{obj})) (C_{i} - \hat{C}_{i})^{2} + \sum_{i=0}^{S^{2}} \sum_{C=C} \mathbb{1}_{i}^{obj} (p_{i}(c) - \hat{p}_{i}(c))^{2}

L = L_{cls} + L_{loc}

<p align="justify">
Because of model instability due to the inbalance between cells containing or not containing objects the authors use two scale parameters to increase the loss from bounding box predictions ($\lambda_{coord} = 0.5$) and decrease the loss from confidence predictions for boxes that don't contain objects ($\lambda_{noobj} = 0.5$). The loss function only penalizes classification error if an object is present in that grid cell and it only penalizes bbox error if the cell is "responsible" for the ground truth box.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Some more training details: The authors trained YOLO on VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 with a batch size of 64, momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 0.0005. For regularization they rely on dropout and data augmentation.
</p>
<h3 id="shortcomings">Shortcomings</h3>
<ul>
<li>strong spatial constraints since we have only one prediction per grid cell (7x7 -&gt; max. 49 object predictions); this is one of the reasons why the model struggles with crowds of small objects</li>
<li>struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual aspect ratios or configurations (maybe this could be reduced with clever data augmentation or training on different image scales)</li>
<li>many incorrect localizations due to an inappropriate loss function and coarse features for bounding box prediction (multiple downsampling layers)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yolov2">YOLOv2</h2>
<p align="justify">
YOLOv2 is basically an improved version of YOLO, adding some tricks to overcome its shortcomings described before. Moreover the paper covers YOLO9000 which is built on top of YOLOv2 and trained with a joint dataset combining COCO and the top 9000 classes of ImageNet (combination of detection and classification). I will only cover YOLOv2 here, for those of you who are interested in YOLO9000 and the joint training procedure, should take a look a the paper.
</p>
<p align="justify">
As mentioned before, the central goal of YOLOv2 was to fix the problems of YOLO, primarily recall and localization shortcomings. The authors did this based on a variety of new ideas in the field (at that time) and they try to avoid increasing the model size at the same time to preserve the high speed:
</p>
<p><strong>Batch Normalization:</strong> This leads to significant improvements in convergence while eliminating the need for other forms of regularization like dropout (+2% mAP).</p>
<p><strong>High Resolution Classifier:</strong> Finetune the classification network at higher resolution (448x448) for 10 epochs on ImageNet before detection finetuning.</p>
<p><strong>Convolutional Anchor Box Detection:</strong> The fully connected layers from YOLO are removed and instead YOLOv2 incorporates anchor boxes (like Faster R-CNN) to predict the bounding boxes; this also decouples the class prediction from the spatial location by predicting class and objectness for every anchor box which leads to a slight decrease in accuracy (-0.3% mAP) but increases recall significantly (+7%) which gives the model more room to improve.</p>
<p><strong>Box Dimension Clustering:</strong> Instead of using hand picked anchor box sizes, YOLOv2 runs k-means clustering on the training data to determine good priors for anchor box dimensions; to maximize IoU scores, it relies on the following distance metric:</p>
<p>$$
d(x, c_{i}) = 1 - IoU(x, c_{i}), \quad i=i,&hellip;k
$$</p>
<p>where $x$ is a ground truth box candidate and $c_{i}$ is one of the centroids / the closest centroid.</p>
<p><strong>Direct Location Prediction:</strong> In Region Proposal Networks the box location prediction is unconstrained which means any anchor box can end up at any point in the image which can lead to an unstable training. YOLOv2 follows the approach of the original YOLO model by predicting location coordinates relative to the location of the grid cell (using a logistic activation). Given the anchor box width $p_{w}$ and height $p_{h}$ in the grid cell with the top left corner ($c_{x}, c_{y}$) the model predicts 5 values ($t_{x}, t_{y}, t_{w}, t_{h}, t_{o}$) which correspond to the following box values:</p>
<p>$$
b_{x} = \sigma (t_{x}) + c_{x} \
b_{y} = \sigma (t_{y}) + c_{y} \
b_{w} = p_{w}e^{t_{w}} \
b_{h} = p_{h}e^{t_{h}} \
Pr(obj) =IoU(b, obj) = \sigma (t_{o})
$$</p>
<p>This in combination with clustering priors improves mAP by up to 5%.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Fine-grained Features:</strong> The grid size of the final feature map of YOLOv2 is increased from 7x7 in YOLO to 13x13. Moreover YOLOv2 incorporates a so called passthrough layer that brings features from an earlier layer at 26x26 resolution to the output layer. This process can be compared with identity mappings from ResNets to incorporate higher dimensional features (+1% mAP).</p>
<p><strong>Multi-scale Training:</strong> To increase the robustness of the model the authors trained it on images of different sizes. Every 10 batches the input size gets randomly sampled (between 320x320 and 608x608).</p>
<p align="justify">
To maintain the high inference speed, YOLOv2 is based on the <b>Darknet-19</b> model, consisting of 19 convolutional and 5 max-pooling layers. For detailed information on the architecture check out Table 6 in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf">paper</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="retinanet">RetinaNet</h2>
<p align="justify">
Next up in our list of fast detection models is RetinaNet. The creators had the goal of closing the accuracy gap between one and two-stage detection approaches. To achieve this, RetinaNet relies on two crucial building blocks, <b>Feature Pyramid Networks</b> (FPN) as a backbone and a new loss function called <b>Focal Loss</b>.
</p>
<h3 id="focal-loss">Focal Loss</h3>
<p align="justify">
The central cause for the accuracy gap between the two approaches lies in the extreme foreground-background class imbalance during training. In two-stage detectors this problem is addressed by narrowing down the number of candidate object locations (filtering out many background samples) and by using sampling heuristics like a fixed foreground-to-background ratio or online hard example mining. The proposed Focal Loss is designed to address this issue for one-stage detectors by focusing on hard negatives and down-weighting the easier predictions (obvious empty background). It is based on the normal cross entropy loss (for simplicity we use binary loss down here)
</p>
<p>$$CE(p,y) = -y \log p - (1-y) \log (1 - p) $$</p>
<p align="justify">
where $y={0,1}$ is a ground truth binary label, indicating whether a bounding box contains an object and $p \in [0,1]$ is the predicted probability that there is an object (also called objectness or confidence score). For notational convenience, let
</p>
<p>$$
p_{t} =
\begin{cases}
p       &amp; \quad \text{if } y=1\
1-p     &amp; \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$</p>
<p>which leads to</p>
<p>$$
CE(p_{t}) = - \log p_{t}
$$</p>
<p align="justify">
Easily classified negatives ($p_{t} \gg 0.5 ,y=0$) comprise the majority of the loss. You can balance the importance of the positive/negative examples by adding a balancing factor $\alpha$
</p>
<p>$$
CE(p_{t}) = - \alpha_{t} \log p_{t}
$$</p>
<p align="justify">
but this does not differentiate between easy or hard examples. To overcome this the Focal Loss adds a modulating factor $(1-p_{t})^{\gamma}$ with a tunable focusing parameter $\gamma \geq 0$:
</p>
<p>$$
FL(p_{t}) = - (1 - p_{t})^{\gamma} \log (p_{t})
$$</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p align="justify">
For better control of the shape of the weighting function the authors used an $\alpha$-balanced version in practice, where $\alpha = 0.25$ and $\gamma = 2$ worked best in their experiments:
</p>
<p>$$
FL(p_{t}) = - \alpha (1 - p_{t})^{\gamma} \log (p_{t})
$$</p>
<h3 id="feature-pyramid-network">Feature Pyramid Network</h3>
<p align="justify">
The FPN backbone for RetinaNet was constructed on top of ResNet. To really understand what that means you should take a look at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03144.pdf">paper</a>. Figure 4 down below shows the fundamental idea of FPN which is to leverage a ConvNets pyramidal feature hierarchy to build a feature pyramid with high level semantics throughout. It is general purpose and can be applied to many convolutional backbone architectures.
</p>
<figure class="align-center ">

            <p>Figure 4. Featurized Pyramid Network architecture</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p align="justify">
The basic structure contains a sequence of pyramid levels each corresponding to one network stage. Often these stages contain multiple conv layers of the same size and stage sizes are scaled down by a factor of two. $C_{i}$ represents the different layers of those stages (for ResNet e.g. {$C_{2}, C_{3}, C_{4}, C_{5}$}). As you can see there are two different pathways which connect the conv layers:
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bottom-up</strong> pathway: regular feedback path</li>
<li><strong>Top-down</strong> pathway: goes in the opposite direction, adding coarse but semantically stronger feature maps back into the previous levels of layer size by lateral connections (1x1 conv to match dimensions) and nearest neighbor upsampling; the combination of the two maps is done by element-wise addition</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">
The final predictions ({$P_{i}$} where $i$ indicates the pyramid level and has resolution $2^{i}$ lower than the input) are generated out of every merged map by a 3x3 conv layer. RetinaNet utilizes feature pyramid levels $P_{3}$ to $P_{7}$ computed from the corresponding ResNet residual stage from $C_{3}$ to $C_{5}$. All pyramid levels have 256 channels (most of RetinaNet is similar to FPN with a few minor differences). The authors used translation-invariant anchor boxes as priors, similar to those used in RPN variant of FPN. To improve Average Precision the number of anchors was increased to $A=9$ (three aspect ratios {1:2, 1:1, 2:1} with three different sizes {$2^{0}, 2^{1/3}, 2^{2/3}$}). As seen before, for each anchor box the model predicts a class probability for each of $K$ classes with a classification subnet trained with Focal Loss. A box regression subnet outputs the offsets for the boxes to the nearest ground truth object. Both networks are independent Fully Convolutional Networks that don't share any parameters.

<h2 id="yolov3">YOLOv3</h2>
<p align="justify">
YOLOv3 was created by applying changes to YOLOv2 inspired by, at that time, recent advances in the object detection world. It's a pretty short and rather unscientifically (I like it :D ) written. The following list summarizes the most important improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logistic Regression for objectness scores</strong> instead of sum of squared errors</li>
<li><strong>Independent Logistic Classifiers</strong> for class prediction instead of softmax which increases the performance on non mutually exclusive multilabel datasets like Open Images</li>
<li><strong>Multi-scale predictions</strong> inspired by FPN (3 scales per stage)</li>
<li><strong>Darknet-53 as Feature Extractor</strong> which performs similar to ResNet-152 but is 2x faster</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
Overall YOLOv3 performs better and faster than SSD, worse then RetinaNet but is 3.8x faster and comparable to state-of-the-art methods on the $AP_{50}$ metric at that time. In the appendix Joseph (the author) adds a cool comment on his opinion about the COCO evaluation metrics. It's refreshing to see someone questioning stuff like this.

<p align="justify">
In the following weeks (or months) I am going to take a deep dive into Deep Learning based Object Detection models. My goal is to create a series of posts regarding different approaches and popular architectures for this task. In this post I'll start with the description of the R-CNN ("Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks") model family, their emergence and central ideas. Nowadays there exist much more accurate and efficient architectures but I think it's a good starting point for such a series. Since the R-CNN based models are so called two-stage approaches, I'll go over a few popular one-stage architectures like YOLO in the next post as well. I'll describe in a minute what exactly this means and what the key differences are. Furthermore, following these two posts, I would like to discuss more current architectures that represent the state-of-the-art in the most recognized benchmarks like <i>EfficientDet</i> or new Transformer-based approaches like <i>DETR</i>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
As mentioned before, we can broadly distinguish between one and two-stage detection frameworks. A typical two-stage pipeline consists of an initial category-independent region-proposal stage followed by the feature extraction and classification. This allows for a high localization and recognition accuracy. In contrast single-stage object detectors do not require prior proposals which makes them faster but less accurate. But more on that in the next post. Now let's start with the R-CNN models.
</p>
<h2 id="r-cnn">R-CNN</h2>
<p align="justify">
Ross Girshick et al. presented their approach called "Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks" (R-CNN) in 2014. It was one of the first methods based on deep convolutional networks (CNNs) besides e.g. <i>Overfeat</i>. The main idea is to tackle the problem of Object Detection in several successive steps, as shown in Figure 1.
</p>
<figure class="align-center ">

            <p>Figure 1. R-CNN model workflow [1]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p align="justify">
It was an important contribution to the Computer Vision community because of the significant improvement of the state-of-the-art at that time (mAP improvement of more than 30% on PASCAL VOC). Moreover the structure as well as the workflow of the framework are pretty straightforward:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Extract around 2000 of category-independent bounding box object region candidates per image using <a href="https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/isis/publications/bibtexbrowser.php?key=UijlingsIJCV2013&amp;bib=all.bib">selective search</a></li>
<li>Each region candidate gets warped to have a fixed size of 227x227 pixels which is required by the CNN (you can detailed information on how this is done in the Appendix of the paper)</li>
<li>Extract the features of each candidate with a CNN (AlexNet)</li>
<li>Classification of each region with class-specific Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
<li>Bounding box regression based on the predicted class, predict bounding box offsets (boosts up mAP by 3-4 points)</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">
The overall training procedure is a stepwise process and requires a lot of work. First you have to pretrain your CNN classification on ImageNet. In the next step you have to get rid of the last classification layer and insert a new one with $K+1$ classes ($K$ = number of classes ;+1 for background). Start finetuning this network using warped proposal windows. It is very important for training that you reduce your learning rate when finetuning (0.01 for ImageNet and 0.001 for finetuning). In the training process all proposals with an Intersection over Union (IoU) >= 0.5 are considered positive samples. The mini-batch size here was 128, consisting of 32 positive and 96 negative boxes, so its biased towards the positives (selective search produces much more negatives than positives). After finetuning your CNN we start building the class-specific binary SVMs. Here a the authors used grid search to choose the IoU threshold of 0.3. In addition to speed up the process they used hard negativ mining. If you want the details on why it is done this way you can look it up in the Appendix of the paper. The last step of the training procedure is the creation of class-specific bounding box regressors, which output bbox offsets. To train these only proposals with an IoU >= 0.6 are used.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Now let's dive a bit deeper into <b>Bounding Box Regression</b>. The offsets get calculated based on the features after $pool_{5}$ layer of each proposal $\mathbf{p}$. The regressor is build to learn scale-invariant transformations between the centers and a log-scale transformation between widths and heights. This is illustrated down below.
</p>
<figure class="align-center ">

<p>$$
\hat{g}_{x} = p_{w}d_{x}(\mathbf{p}) + p_{x} \
\hat{g}_{y} = p_{h}d_{y}(\mathbf{p}) + p_{y} \
\hat{g}_{w} = p_{w}e^{d_{w}(\mathbf{p})} \
\hat{g}_{h} = p_{h}e^{d_{h}(\mathbf{p})}
$$</p>
<p>$\mathbf{p}$ represents the predicted bbox information $(p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{w}, p_{h})$ whereas $\mathbf{g}$ contains the ground truth values $(g_{x}, g_{y}, g_{w}, g_{h})$. The targets to learn are the following:</p>
<p>$$
t_{x} = (g_{x} - p_{x}) / p_{w} \
t_{y} = (g_{y} - p_{y}) / p_{h} \
t_{w} = \log (g_{w} / p_{w}) \
t_{h} = \log (g_{h} / p_{h})
$$</p>
<p align="justify">
A regression model can solve the problem by minimizing the Sum of Squared Error Loss with regularization (ridge regression):
</p>
<p>$$
L_{reg} = \sum_{i \in { x, y, w, h }} (t_{i} - d_{i}(\mathbf{p}))^{2} + \lambda | \mathbf{w} |^{2}
$$</p>
<p align="justify">
The regularization term ($\lambda$ = 1000) is critical and the authors picked it by using cross validation. One benefit of the application of these transformations is that alle the box correction functions $d_{i}(p)$ where $i \in \{ x, y, w, h \}$ can take any value $[- \infty, + \infty]$.

<p><strong>Shortcomings:</strong></p>
<ul>

<h2 id="fast-r-cnn">Fast R-CNN</h2>
<p align="justify">
To overcome these shortcomings described above, Girshick improved the R-CNN training procedure by unifying the three models into one jointly trainable framework called <b>Fast R-CNN</b>. Instead of extracting feature vectors for every object proposal separately, here the entire image gets forward passed through a deep CNN (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf">VGG16</a>)) to produce a convolutional feature map. For each object proposal a <b>Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer</b> extracts a fixed length feature vector from this feature map. Those feature vectors are then fed into multiple fully-connected layers which finally branch into the object classifier and a bounding box regressor. This intergration leads to a lot of shared computation which speeds up the whole prediction process.

<p align="justify">
One new key component of the proposed framework is the RoI pooling layer which is a type of max pooling that allows us to convert the features inside any valid region proposals into a feature map with a fixed window of size H $\times$ W. This is done by dividing the input region into H $\times$ W small grids where every subwindow size is approximately of size [h/H $\times$ w/W]. In each of those grid cells apply regular max pooling.

<p align="justify">
The training procedure of this framework is somewhat similar to the one of R-CNN. Here they also pre-train a deep CNN on ImageNet and use selective search for proposal generation. After pre-training the last max pooling layer is replaced by a RoI pooling layer which is set to be compatible with the nets first fully connected layer, for VGG16 H = W = 7. The last fully connected layer and softmax are replaced by two sibling layers, one for classification consisting of one fully connected layer followed by a softmax over $K+1$ categories and one for category-specific bounding box regressors. Another major advantage of this approach is the possibility of end-to-end training with a multi-task loss. This loss function sums up the cost of classification and bbox prediction:
</p>
<p>$$
L(p,u,t^{u},v) = L_{cls}(p,u) + \lambda [u \geq 1] L_{loc}(t^{u}, v)

As mentioned before Fast R-CNN is much faster in training and testing but one speed bottleneck in form of selective search still remains which leads us to the next evolutionary stage of the architecture.
</p>
<h2 id="faster-r-cnn">Faster R-CNN</h2>
<p align="justify">
Here the region proposal step gets integrated into the CNN in form of a so called <b>Region Proposal Network</b> (RPN) that shares conv features with the detection network ("it tells the classification network where to look").
</p>
<p align="justify">
The RPN takes an image of arbitrary size as input and outputs a set of rectangular object proposals and objectness scores (= object vs. background). It is important to keep in mind that the goal here is to share computation, so a set of conv layers is chosen to be also part of the object detection pipeline to extract features.

<p align="justify">
To generate region proposals, a small $n \times n$ spatial window gets slided over the last shareable conv feature map to create lower dimensional feature vectors (256 dims). These reduced feature vectors get fed into two sibling fully connected layers, a bbox regression  layer and a box classification layer. It is implemented using one $n \times n$ convolution and two $1 \times 1$ conv layers. The classification part is implemented as a two class softmax layer. At each sliding window location $k$ regions of various scales and ratios get proposed simultaneously (k = 9). Those proposals are parameterized relative to $k$ reference boxes called <b>anchors</b>. Each anchor is centered at the sliding window position and is associated with a combination of different aspect ratios (1:1, 1:2, 2:1) and scales (128x128, 256x256, 512x512). This multi-scale anchor-based design is a key component for sharing features without extra cost for addressing scales and aspect ratios.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The loss function used to train the RPN is also a multi-task loss which is similar to the one of Fast R-CNN we discussed before:
</p>
<p>$$
L({p_{i}},{t_{i}}) = \frac{1}{N_{cls}} \sum L_{cls} (p_{i}, p_{i}^{\ast}) + \lambda \frac{1}{N_{reg}} \sum p_{i}^{\ast} L_{reg} (t_{i}, t_{i}^{\ast})

<p>The regression loss is also smooth $L_{1}$ like in Fast R-CNN. The classification loss can be calculated as followed:</p>
<p>$$
L_{cls} (p_{i}, p_{i}^{\ast}) = -p_{i}^{\ast} \log p_{i} - (1 - p_{i}^{\ast}) \log (1 - p_{i})
$$</p>
<p align="justify">
For the calculations of $t\_{i}$ and $t\_{i}^{\ast}$ take a look at section 3.1.2 of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497">paper</a>. To train the network the authors use a mini batch size of 256 randomly sampled anchors consisting of 128 positives and negatives (padded with negative ones if necessary). All anchors which are beyond the image boundaries are ignored in the training process. For the Fast R-CNN framework integration the authors experimented with different training strategies and chose an alternating one. First they train the RPN and then the Fast R-CNN using the RPN proposals and the trainede backbone. Thereafter they initialize the RPN with the tuned Fast R-CNN network and iterate a couple of times. For detailed evaluation and benchmarks take a look at the paper.
</p>
<h2 id="mask-r-cnn">Mask R-CNN</h2>
<p align="justify">
In the last step of this "evolution", Faster R-CNN was further extended to the task of pixel level instance segmentation, called <b>Mask R-CNN</b>. A third branch is added in parallel to the existing classification and localization branches for predicting binary object masks for every proposed RoI of size $m \times m$.
</p>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/imgs/object_detection_1/mask-rcnn.png#center"

            <p>Figure 6. Mask R-CNN architecture</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p align="justify">
The mask branch consists of a fully convolutional network (FCN) which allows each layer to maintain the explicit $m \times m$ object spatial layout without collapsing it into a vector representation that lacks those spatial dimensions. To ensure high quality and precision mask predictions the RoI features have to be well aligned to preserve the explicit per-pixel spatial correspondence. The RoI pooling layer lacks the required precision because of quantization which motivated the authors to develop the so called <b>RoI Align</b> layer. RoI Align avoids quantization and instead uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation">Bilinear Interpolation</a> to compute the exact values of the input features at four regularly sampled locations in each RoI bin and aggregate the result (max or avg pooling). This leads to large improvements in mask prediction quality. To get a good understanding of how RoI Align works, take a look at the following <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-region-of-interest-part-2-roi-align-and-roi-warp-f795196fc193">blogpost</a>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The authors also demonstrate the generality of the proposed framework by experimenting with different backbones (ResNet, ResNext, FPN, ...) and heads for prediction of bboxes, classification and mask prediction. Moreover, they show that the framework is able to predict keypoints with minimal adjustments. For details on this, take a look at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870">paper</a>. For training the multi-task loss of Faster R-CNN for each RoI gets extended by adding a mask loss:
</p>
<p>$$
L_{mask} = -\frac{1}{m^{2}} \sum_{1 \leq i, j \leq m} [ y_{ij} \log \hat{y}_{ij}^{k} + (1-y_{ij}) \log (1 - \hat{y}_{ij}^{k}) ]
$$</p>
<p align="justify">
$y_{ij}$ describes the label of a cell (i,j) in the true mask whereas $\hat{y}_{ij}^{k}$ represents the predicted value of cell (i,j). The loss is defined as the average binary cross entropy loss, only including the k-th mask if the region is associated with the ground truth class $k$. The mask branch outputs $K * m^{2}$ binary masks but only the k-th mask contributes to the loss (rest gets ignored). This provides a decoupling between class and mask predictions.

<p>When people in the Machine Learning community talk about Pose Estimation, one can usually assume that they are talking about Human Pose Estimation (HPE). All of the known benchmarks or datasets in the field of pose estimation are based on images of people. Maybe this is due to the many potential applications of such models, e.g. Action/Activity Recognition, movies and animation, Human Computer Interaction, medical assistance, sports motion, self-driving [5]. HPE is a very difficult and challenging problem due to possible strong articulations, small and barely visible joints or keypoints, occlusions, self-similar parts, and a high variance in clothing and lighting. But first of all, what exactly is HPE?</p>
<p>Basically you can differentiate between 2D and 3D pose estimation. In <strong>2D Pose Estimation</strong> a 2D pose of (x,y) coordinates for each joint from a RGB image are estimated. In <strong>3D Pose Estimation</strong> you also incorporate the prediction of a third coordinate z. In this article I will only talk about Deep Learning-based HPE models because nowadays nearly all of these models consist of a Deep Learning part (in most cases Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)). The first CNN was applied in 2013 by Jain et al. [15]. Before this the best approaches for this task were based on body part detectors (multiple stages of processing). In this blogpost we are going to look closer at the field of deep learning-based 2D HPE (green area in Figure 1) where the basis are exclusively 2D images or videos.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Until today a lot has been done in the field of HPE. A wide range of approaches have been researched to make progress in this challenging area. The goal of this blogpost is to give you an overview of the field of HPE, different datasets, evaluation metrics and popular architectures. First of all, there are so many papers and models out there that I cover only a few of them but I try to incorporate the most “popular” ones. For a more scientific view on this I encourage you to check out this recent review here [5]. Since I am a pretty normal human being and far from perfect, there can be mistakes in this blogpost, so if you find one I encourage you to send me an email and then I’ll fix it. Nevertheless, I hope that you like the post and that it is useful for you or exactly what you were looking for.</p>
<h2 id="approaches">Approaches</h2>
<p>There are many more possibilities on how to categorize this broad field (e.g. generative vs. discriminative, regression-based vs. detection-based, one-stage vs. multi-stage). In this blogpost I will focus on multi-person HPE because this automatically implies the single-person pose estimation domain (what I mean by this will be clear in a minute). I differentiate between <em>Top-down</em> and <em>Bottom-up</em> approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Top-down:</strong> This is a two stage approach where you combine a human detection model (like Faster-RCNN) with a single-person pose estimation model. The detection model first predicts bounding boxes of the people in an image which you feed the pose estimation model which then predicts the keypoint coordinates for the person in the bounding box. This approach depends on the performance of the upstream detection model and can be computationally expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom-up:</strong> The typical bottom-up HPE framework includes two stages, keypoint detection and grouping. Approaches which work this way and which are part of this blogpost are DeeperCut, OpenPose and Associative Embedding. The challenge with these models lies primarily in the correct grouping or assignment of the keypoints to the corresponding person especially in the case of unnatural poses, distortions or heavy occlusions. Important strengths of these approaches, as opposed to top-down approaches, are scalability and runtime because they don’t rely on the person detector.</p>
<h2 id="datasets">Datasets</h2>
<p>Datasets are essential for fair comparison of different algorithms and bring more challenges and complexity through their expansion and improvement in recent years. In this section we present you the most important and popular datasets in the domain of 2D HPE. For a very nice and short overview take a look at Table 7 in [5].</p>
<h3 id="frames-labeled-in-cinema-flic">Frames Labeled in Cinema (FLIC)</h3>
<p>The FLIC dataset [30] contains 5,003 images collected from popular Hollywood movies. For every tenth frame of 30 movies, a person detector was run to obtain about 20,000 person candidates. The groundtruth labels (10 upper body joints) were obtained through the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing marketplace (median-of-five labeling). Those labeled images were checked and rejected manually by the authors if the person was occluded or severly non-frontal. The <em>FLIC-full</em> dataset is the full set of frames including occluded, non-frontal and plain mislabeled frames. Because many of the training set images contain samples from the test set (1,016 images) scenes which allows unfair overtraining on the FLIC test set Tompson et al. [34] proposed a new dataset called <em>FLIC-plus</em> which is a 17380 images subset from the <em>FLIC-full</em> dataset without these problems.</p>
<h3 id="leeds-sport-pose">Leeds Sport Pose</h3>
<p>The Leeds Sport Pose dataset (LSP) [17] contains 2,000 images of full-body poses collected from Flickr by downloading with 8 sports tags: athletics, badminton, baseball, gymnastics, parkour, soccer, tennis and volleyball. The annotations include up to 14 different visible joints. Figure 2 shows a few examples from the original dataset.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">

            <p>Figure 2. Some examples from the original LSP dataset [17]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A year later Johnson et al. [18] published the extended version of this dataset containing 10,000 images collected from Flickr searches with the 3 most challenging tags: parkour, gymnastics and athletics. As for FLIC the annotations were generated by the Amazon Mechanical Turk service. The problem with this dataset is that the authors cannot guarantee for the quality of the labels.</p>
<h3 id="mpii-human-pose-dataset">MPII Human Pose Dataset</h3>
<p>The Human Pose dataset from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPII) [2] is one of the state-of-the-art benchmarks for HPE with rich annotations. The dataset includes around 25,000 images with more than 40,000 people with 16 annotated joints. Furthermore the dataset covers 410 human activities which is also part of the image annotations. The images were extracted from YoutTube videos. Figure 3 shows some random images from the dataset and the associated activites.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">

</figure>

<p>Images in MPII have various body poses and are suitable for many tasks such as 2D single- and multiple HPE, action recognition, etc.</p>
<h3 id="coco-keypoints">COCO Keypoints</h3>
<p>The Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset [22] is a large-scale dataset that was originally proposed for object detection and segmentation in natural environments. Over time the dataset was improved and extended e.g. with image captions and keypoint labels. The images were collected from Google, Bing and Flickr image search with isolated as well as pairwise object categories. The annotations were also conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">

            <p>Figure 4. Some examples from the COCO 2020 keypoint detection task [2]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The whole dataset contains more than 200,000 images and 250,000 labeled person instances. Annotations on train and validation sets with over 150,000 people and 1.7 million labeled keypoints are publicly available. The annotations for each person include 17 body joints with visibility and left/right labels, and instance human body segmentation. Moreover the COCO dataset contains about 120,000 unlabeled images following the same class distribution as the labeled images which can be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning.</p>
<h3 id="aic-hkd-dataset">AIC-HKD Dataset</h3>
<p>The AI Challenger Human Keypoint Dataset (AIC-HKD) [37] is a subset of the large-scale dataset called AI Challenger. It is the biggest benchmark dataset out there containing 210,000 images for training, 30,000 for validation and 60,000 for testing. For the 210 000 images in training set, there are 378,374 human figures with almost 5 million keypoints. Among all the human keypoints 78.4% of them are labeled as visible(v = 1) and the rest of them are labeled as not visible(v = 2). All of these images were collected from Internet search engines. Inappropriate images (e.g. politicians, sexual contents) were removed manually. In addition, images with too many human figures (e.g. crowds in a soccer stadium) and those with very small human figures were excluded. The skeleton consists of 14 different human skeletal keypoints with one of three possible visibility flags: labeled and visible, labeled but not visible or not labeled.</p>
<p>In addition to the presented 2D image datasets there exist video-based datasets for the same purpose e.g. the Penn Action Dataset [41], the Joint-annotated Human Motion Database (J-HMDB) [16], PoseTrack [1]. You can also check them out if you are interested in this.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Because of the fact that different datasets have different features, e.g. various range of human body sizes, full or only upper human body, in combination with different task requirements (single- or multi-person) there exist several evaluation metrics for 2D HPE. In the following I will describe the most common evaluation metrics in HPE which are regularly used to compare different approaches</p>
<h3 id="percentage-of-correct-parts">Percentage of Correct Parts</h3>
<p>Percentage of Correct Parts (PCP) [10] is widely used in early research as evaluation metric. A limb is considered detected if the distance between the two predicted joint locations and the true limb joint locations is less than 50% of the limb length (commonly denoted as <a href="mailto:PCP@0.5">PCP@0.5</a>). The smaller the PCP value, the better the performance of the model. The drawback of this metric is that it penalizes shorter limbs because shorter limbs like lower arms which are usually harder to detect. Moreover there exist a few slightly modified versions of this metric.</p>
<h3 id="percentage-of-correct-keypoints">Percentage of Correct Keypoints</h3>
<p>The Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) [31] measures the accuracy of the localization of body joints where a candidate joint is considered as correct if it is within a certain distance or threshold of the groundtruth joint. The threshold can e.g. be a fraction of the person bounding box [40] or 50% of the head bone link, which is denoted as <a href="mailto:PCKh@0.5">PCKh@0.5</a> [3]. This alleviates the problem with shorter limbs mentioned before and is e.g. the standard evaluation metric for MPII evaluation. Another possibility is to use a pixel radius normalized by the torso height of each test sample as threshold value [30], which is also denoted as Percentage of Detected Joints (PDJ) by [35].</p>
<h3 id="average-precision--recall">Average Precision &amp; Recall</h3>
<p>Imagine you have a dataset with groundtruth labels for different keypoints but without the bounding boxes. How do you evaluate your approach on such a dataset? You can use Average Presicion (AP) similar to object detection. If a predicted joint falls within a threshold of the groundtruth joint location, it is counted as true positive. For MPPE evaluation, all predicted poses are assigned to the groundtruth poses one by one based on the PCKh score order while unassigned predictions are counted as false positives. The mean AP (mAP) is reported from the AP of each body joint. For the COCO dataset AP, AR and their variants are reported based on the object keypoint similarity (OKS, more on this down below) which plays a similar role as the Intersection over Union (IoU).</p>
<h3 id="object-keypoint-similarity">Object Keypoint Similarity</h3>
<p>The Object Keypoint Similarity evaluation metric (OKS) is used for the Keypoint Evaluation in the COCO benchmark. For each object in this dataset the ground truth keypoints have the form $([x_{1}, y_{1}, v_{1}, &hellip;, x_{k}, y_{k}, v_{k}])$ where $(x)$ and $(y)$ are the keypoint locations and $(v)$ is a visibility flag (0 : not labeled; 1 : labeled but not visible; 2 : labeled and visible). On top of that each ground truth label has a scale $(s)$ which is defined as the square root of the object segment area.</p>
<p>The OKS is defined as followed:</p>
<p>$$OKS = \frac{\sum_{i} exp(-d_{i}^{2} / 2s^{2}k_{i}^{2}) \delta (v_{i} &gt; 0)}{\sum_{i} \delta (v_{i} &gt; 0)}$$</p>
<p>Here $d_{i}$ also describes the euclidean distance between the ground truth keypoint and the detection and $k_{i}$ is a per-keypoint constant that controls falloff.</p>
<h3 id="computational-performance">Computational Performance</h3>
<p>The computational performance metrics are also very important in the field of HPE. The <em>Frame Rate</em> indicates the processing speed of input data, generally expressed by Frames per Second (FPS) or seconds per image (s/image). This is an important metrics e.g. for real-world applications which require real-time-estimation. The <em>Number of Weights/Parameters</em> and the <em>GFLOPs</em> (Giga Floating-point Operations per second) are two key performance indicators often mentioned.

<p>In the following I will describe a few popular architectures in Single- and Multi-Human Pose Estimation but there are much more out there.</p>
<h3 id="learning-human-pose-estimation-features-with-convolutional-networks-2013">Learning Human Pose Estimation Features with Convolutional Networks (2013)</h3>
<p>This paper [15] describes the first deep learning approach to tackle the problem of single-person full body human pose estimation with convolutional neural networks. In this approach the authors trained multiple independent binary classification networks, one network per keypoint. The model is applied in a sliding window approach and outputs a response map indicating the confidence of the body part at that location. Figure 5 shows the architecture of the classification models.</p>

<p>The input is of shape 64x64 pixel and locally contrast normalized (LCN). As activation functions ReLU is used. To reduce computational complexity max pooling is applied twice which leeds to some spatial information loss. After the three convoliutional layers follow three fully connected layers. To reduce overfitting, L2 regularization and dropout are applied in the fully connected layers. The output layer is a single logistic unit, representing the probability of a body part being in the patch. Moreover the authors use part priors for the final prediction. For a detailed breakdown of how all this works you should have a look at the paper. The model was evaluated on the FLIC dataset based on the PCK metric described before [31]. Figure 6 shows the performance on the wrist, elbow and shoulder joints of 351 FLIC test set images.</p>

<h3 id="convolutional-pose-machines-2016">Convolutional Pose Machines (2016)</h3>
<p>A Convolutional Pose Machine [36] is a single-person Human Pose Estimation model which incorporates convolutional networks into the pose machine framework and inherits its benefits like the implicit learning of long-range spatial dependencies and a modular sequential design. This results in a differentiable architecture that allows for end-to-end training with backpropagation on large amounts of data. Figure 7 shows the overall architecture of the model.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">

<p>It consists of a sequence of stages (ConvNets) which produce 2D belief maps (heatmaps) for each part/keypoint. Before the images are fed into the network they are scaled down to a size of 368x368 pixels. The first stage consists of seven convolutional and three pooling layers with different kernel sizes. The second and all following stages are different from the first one. Here you use the first layers (share weights) of stage one to produce a belief map which is then concatenatet to the output map of the previous stage. After that you feed the concatenated maps into five more convolutional layers. Every stage outputs P+1 belief maps of 46x46 pixels where P is the number of parts and the additional belief map is for the background. At every stage of the model a loss (MSE) is computed based on these belief maps and divided by the number of pixel values (46x46x15). This also addresses the problem of vanishing gradients. In the end, these individual losses are added together to form an overall loss. At every stage the prediction quality is refined as you can see in Figure 8.</p>

<p>In the first and second stage the model isn’t sure which of the two wrists is the right one but in the third stage it seems to be certain. The same goes for the elbows. The model is evaluated on the MPII, FLIC and the Leeds Sports Pose datasets (for detailed information on the performance on all of these, take a look at the original paper). Figure 9 shows the results on MPII in comparison to other state-of-the-art models at that time. The evaluation is based on PCKh metric.</p>

<h3 id="deepercut-2016">Deep(er)Cut (2016)</h3>
<p>DeeperCut [13] is an improved version of the DeepCut [28] model which is a multi-person pose estimation approach based on integer-linear programming (ILP) that jointly estimates poses of all people present in an image by minimizing a joint objective. One of the differences between Deep and DeeperCut is that they replace the VGG backbone from the part detector with a modified ResNet-152 for computing part probability scoremaps. This also increases the size of the receptive field from 400 to 1000px which allows a better incorporation of context in the predictions. In addition location refinement is performed by predicting offsets from the locations on the scoremap grid to the ground truth joint locations. During training sigmoid activations and cross entropy loss function are applied.</p>
<p>The large receptive field contains enough information to reason about locations of other parts/joints in the vicinity which is why the authors also use deep networks to make pairwise part-to-part predictions. Those are subsequently used to compute pairwise probabilities. For detailed information on the computations and the incorporation of these pairwise probabilities I encourage you to take a look at both original papers. For me personally it was pretty hard to follow their thinking and their calculations. Maybe it helps to inspect their implementation on github to deeply understand this. Moreover I don’t know anything about ILP.</p>
<p>The two main problems of the DeepCut ILP approach are long computation times for solving the optimization problem and the fact that no distinction is made between reliable and less-reliable detections. Therefore in DeeperCut not one but several instances of ILP’s are solved based on the reliabilities of the part detections. Figure 10 displays the results on the MPII validation set.</p>

<h3 id="stacked-hourglass-networks-2016">Stacked Hourglass Networks (2016)</h3>
<p>The Stacked Hourglass model [27] is an approach for single-person pose estimation based on repeated bottom-up, top-down processing used in conjunction with intermediate supervision. Its name originates from its modular design and symmetric topology which you can see in Figure 11. One important operational difference between this approach and related work is that they don’t use unpooling or deconvolutional layers instead nearest neighbour upsampling and skip connections for top-down processing are incorporated. But why to use this form of network design?</p>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/imgs/human_pose_estimation/stacked_hourglass_architecture.png#center"

            <p>Figure 11. Stacked Hourglass architecture [27]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is because of the need to capture information at every scale. A final pose estimate requires a coherent understanding of the full body. The hourglass is a simple minimal design that has the capacity to capture important features like e.g. the persons orientation, the arrangement of their limbs and the relationship of adjacent joints. Figure 12 shows one hourglass module which consists of multiple convolutional and max pooling layers used to process features down to a very low resolution. At each max pooling step the network branches off and applies more convolutions at the original pre-pooled resolution. The network reaches its lowest resolution at 4x4 pixels and starts the top-down process of nearest neighbor upsampling followed by elementwise addition operations. After the last hourglass module, two consecutive 1x1 convolutional layers are added to produce the final network predictions which is a set of heatmaps containing the probability of a joints presence at each and every pixel.</p>

            <p>Figure 12. Hourglass module [27]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The highest hourglass output resolution is 64x64 due to memory limits. As mentioned in the beginning intermediate supervision is essential for the approach which is realized by the prediction of intermediate heatmaps (between HG modules) upon which a loss can be applied. The final design consists of eight consecutive hourglass modules and a MSE loss is applied to the predictions of all modules using the same ground truth heatmap, consisting of a 2D gaussian with standard deviation of 1px centered on the joint location (similar to the Convolutional Pose Machines approach). The evaluation is carried out on the FLIC and MPII datasets using PCK normalized by torso size for FLIC and head size (PCKh) for MPII. Figure 13 shows the results on MPII. The model has mostly problems with images containing multiple people and occluded joints.</p>

<h3 id="prm-2017">PRM (2017)</h3>
<p>The proposed model is based on the Stacked Hourglass architecture incorporating so called Pyramid Residual Modules (PRM) and a new initialization scheme for multi-branch networks [39]. The goal of the introduction of PRMs is to enhance the robustness of DCNNs against scale variations of visual patterns by learning multi-scale features. Many of the popular CNN architectures are multi-branch networks, e.g. Inception, ResNets, Convolutional Pose Machines, Stacked Hourglass Network for which the existing weight initialization schemes aren’t proper. Therefore the authors propose a new method to initialize multi-branch layers that takes the number of branches into consideration. In this article we will focus on the PRMs so for detailed information on the initialization problem please take a look at the original paper.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/imgs/human_pose_estimation/prm_architecture.png#center"
         alt="PRM based model architecture" width="75%"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 14. PRM based model architecture [39]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The approach presented in this paper is based on the Stacked Hourglass Network which is adopted and the residual units are replaced by PRMs. Figure 14 gives a nice overview of the proposed new framework. As you can see the input image is 256x256px cropped from a resized image according to the annotated body position and scale. Instead of max or average pooling, fractional max pooling is used to obtain input feature maps of different resolutions.
Now lets take a closer look at the proposed PRM and its inner workings. I am more of a visual guy and the provided overview of the different PRM versions helped me understand them better. Mathematically the PRM can be formulated as</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{x}^{(l+1)} = \mathbf{x}^{(l)} + \mathcal{P} (\mathbf{x}^{(l)}, \mathbf{W}^{(l)} )$$</p>
<p>where $(\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{x}^{(l)}; \mathbf{W}^{(l)}))$ is Feature Pyramids decomposed as</p>
<p>$$\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{x}^{(l)}, \mathbf{W}^{(l)}) = g(\displaystyle\sum_{c=1}^{C} f_{c} (\mathbf{x}^{(l)}; \mathbf{w}^{(l)}_{f_{c}}); \mathbf{w}^{(l)}_{g}) + f_{0}(\mathbf{x}^{(l)}; \mathbf{w}^{(l)}_{f_{0}})$$</p>
<p>Here $\mathbf{x}^{(l)}$ and $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ are the input and the filter of the $(l)$-th layer respectively. The $C$ denotes the number of pyramid levels and $\mathbf{W}^{(l)} = {\mathbf{w}_{f_{c}}^{(l)}, \mathbf{w}_{g}^{(l)}}_{c=0}^{C}$ is the set of parameters. To reduce computational and space complexity each $f_{c}(\cdot)$ is designed as a bottleneck structure. As you can see in the Figure 15 the authors experimented with four slightly different PRM architectures which all performed better than the baseline in terms of accuracy, number of parameters and complexity. Between the four new modules PRM-B showed the best balance in terms of accuracy and complexity. The number of pyramid levels $C$ was varied between 3 and 5. The authors observed that increasing $C$ generally improves the performance.</p>

            <p>Figure 15. PRM variants [39]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Important to mention is that the PRM is a general module (not only suitable for HPE) that can be used as the basic building block for various other CNN architectures e.g. in image classification networks. Regarding the training procedure and inference the proposed approach is pretty similar to common HPE approaches, as score maps (heatmaps) generated from a Gaussian represent the body joint locations. A loss is attached at the end of each stack defined by the squared error. The approach was tested on MPII and LSP. The authors used <a href="mailto:PCK@0.2">PCK@0.2</a> for LSP evaluation and <a href="mailto:PCKh@0.5">PCKh@0.5</a> for MPII. Figure 16 displays the evaluation results.</p>

<p>The input images are 256x256 cropped from a resized image according to the annotated body position and scale. The training data is augmented by scaling, rotation, flipping and adding color and noise. In comparison to the baseline hourglass model the complexity is increased by 13.5% (from 23.7M to 26.9M parameters) and the number of GFLOPs (45.9) for a 256x256 image is also increased by 11.4%.</p>
<h3 id="associative-embedding-2017">Associative Embedding (2017)</h3>
<p>The problem of bottom-up MPPE can be broken down into detection and grouping: detecting body joints and grouping them into individual people. Associative Embedding [26] is a single-stage method to tackle this task end-to-end by grouping detections through a process called “tagging”. A tag (real number) associates a detection with other detections of a specific group.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/imgs/human_pose_estimation/asso_architecture.png#center"
         alt="Associative Embedding architecture" width="100%"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 17. Associative Embedding architecture [26]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Figure 17 gives an overview of the approach. Here a stacked hourglass network is used to predict a detection score at each pixel location for each body joint, regardless of person identity. In addition the network automatically groups detections into individual poses. For each joint heatmap a corresponding “tag” heatmap is produced (2m output channels for $m$ body joints). NMS is used to parse detection into individual people by retrieving their corresponding tags at those pixel locations. Then detections are grouped across body parts by comparing the tag values of detections and matching up those which are close enough. Such a group forms then the human pose estimate. The authors use a combination of a detection loss and a grouping loss on the output heatmaps for training the network. The detection loss computes the MSE between the predicted and the groundtruth heatmaps, as we have seen in approaches before. The grouping loss assess how well the predicted tags agree with the groundtruth grouping. Therefore for each person a reference embedding gets produced instead of enforcing the loss across all possible pairs of keypoints. Within an individual, the squared distance between the reference embedding and the predicted embedding for each joint are calculated. Then between pairs of people, their reference embeddings are compared to each other with a penalty that drops exponentially to zero as the distance between two tags increases. Formally this looks the following way. Let $h_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{W \times H}$ be the predicted tagging heatmap for the $k$-th body joint, where $h(x)$ is a tag value at pixel location $x$. Given $N$ people, let the groundtruth joint locations be $T={(n_{nk})}$, $n=1,&hellip;,N$, $k=1,&hellip;,K$, where $n_{nk}$ is the groundtruth pixel location of the $k$-th joint of the $n$-th person. The reference embedding for the $k$-th person would be:</p>
<p>$$\bar{a}_{n} = \frac{1}{K} \displaystyle \sum_{k} h_{k} (n_{nk})$$</p>
<p>The grouping loss can then be defined as</p>
<p>$$L_{g}(h, T) = \frac{1}{N} \displaystyle \sum_{n} \displaystyle \sum_{k} (\bar{h}_{n} - h_{k}(x_{nk}))^{2} + \frac{1}{N^{2}} \displaystyle \sum_{n} \displaystyle \sum_{\bar{n}} \exp { - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^{2}} (\bar{h}_{n} - \bar{h}_{\bar{n}})^{2} }$$</p>
<p>Figure 18 shows an example of the tags produced by the network. In this case the tags are well separated (1D embedding) and the decoding process into groups is straightforward. A final set of predictions is produced by iterating over each joint, starting from the head and taking all activations above a certain threshold after NMS, which from the basis of an initial pool of people. Step by step the other detections are matched and assigned to a person. Important to note here is that no steps are taken to ensure anatomical correctness or reasonable spatial relationships between pairs of joints.</p>

<p>The architecture was evaluated on MPII multi-person and COCO (results in Figure 19). The network used here consists of four stacked hourglass modules with an input size of 512x512 and an output resolution of 128x128. The model outperforms the state-of-the-art models at that time in most of the COCO test-dev metrics.</p>

<h3 id="rmpe-2017">RMPE (2017)</h3>
<p>The Regional-Multi-Person Pose Estimation (RMPE) [9] framework imroves the performance of single-person pose estimation (SPPE) based HPE algorithms and therefore addresses two major problems of top-down HPE approaches: the localization error and redundant detections.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">

</figure>

<p>It consists of three components which are shown in Figure 20: a Symmetric Spatial Transformer Network (SSTN), parametric Pose NMS and a Pose Guided Proposals Generator (PGPG). The bounding box proposals are obtained by an object detection model and fed into the SSTN+SPPE module which generates pose proposals. The SSTN extracts a high-quality single person region from an inaccurate bounding box. Figure 21 gives a detailed overview of the SSTN+SPPE module itself including the parallel SPPE for training. On the right side of the image you see an example from the original spatial transformer paper which illustrates pretty well what it does (in my opinion) with a few different examples from MNIST. The first of the three images is the input image, the second one illustrates the the result of the localisation network which predicts a transformation to apply to the input image. The third one displays the result.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Spatial De-Transformer Network (SDTN) is required for remapping the resulting pose estimation to the original human proposal coordinates (SDTN is an inverse procedure of STN). During training an additional parallel SPPE branch is added to improve the STN extraction quality. This branch omits the SDTN and its output is directly compared to labels of center-located groundtruth poses. The weights of this branch are fixed and is is used to backpropagate pose errors to the STN module. For more detailed information on the STN model I recommend to take a look at the original paper [14].</p>
<p>The generated pose proposals are refined by parametric Pose NMS (eliminate redundancies). This process works in the following way: first the most confident pose is selected as reference and some poses close to it are subject to elimination by applying an elimination criterion (repeat until redundant poses are eliminated) which can be mathematically expressed as follows:</p>
<p>$$f(P_{i}, P_{j}\mid\Lambda,\eta) = 1[d(P_{i},P_{j}\mid\Lambda,\lambda) \leq \eta]$$</p>
<p>$P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ are poses with $m$ joints, denoted as ${\langle k_{i}^{1}, c_{i}^{1} \rangle, &hellip; ,\langle k_{i}^{m}, c_{i}^{m} \rangle}$ where $k_{i}^{j}$ and $c_{i}^{j}$ are the $j^{th}$ joint location and cofidence score. $d(P_{i}, P_{j}\mid\Lambda)$ is a pose distance metric with a parameter set of $\Lambda$ and a threshold $\eta$ as elimination criterion. The distance function consists of two components and can be written as</p>
<p>$$d(P_{i}, P_{j}\mid\Lambda) = K_{sim}(P_{i}, P_{j}\mid\sigma_{1}) + \lambda H_{sim}(P_{i}, P_{j}\mid\sigma_{2})$$</p>
<p>where $\lambda$ is a weight balancing the two distances and $\Lambda={\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\lambda}$. For more details on the two components $K_{sim}$ and $H_{sim}$ you should take a look at the original paper. The parameters described can be determined in a data driven manner.
For better adaptation to imperfect human proposals the authors created a Pose-Guided Proposal Generator which generates a large sample of additional augmented training proposals with the same distribution as the output of the human detector. The distribution of the relative offset between the detected bounding boxes and the groundtruth boxes varies across different poses, so there exists a distribution $P(\delta B\mid atom(P))$ where $\delta B$ is the offsets and $atom(P)$ denotes the atomic pose (determined through k-mean clustering) of $P$. During training for each annotated pose in the training sample, first the atomic pose is looked up and then additional offsets are generated by dense sampling according to $P(\delta B \mid a)$ to produce augmented training proposals.</p>
<p>The new framework was tested on MPII multi-person and MSCOCO keypoints 2016. The authors used the VGG-based [32] SSD-512 [23] model as human detector. In order to guarantee that the entire person region will be extracted, detected human proposals are extended by 30% along both the height and the width. As SPPE the stacked hourglass model, presented before, was incorporated. For the STN network the authors adopted a ResNet-18 as localization network and they used a smaller 4-stack hourglass network as the parallel SPPE.</p>

<p>In Figure 22 you can see the results on both benchmarks. On MPII it is most notable that the framework increases the mAP on difficult joints like wrists, elbows, ankles and knees significantly. On MSCOCO the framework performs as good as CMU-Pose (bottom-up approach) and much better than other approaches the authors looked at. In their ablation studies they evaluated the effectiveness of all three proposed components.</p>
<h3 id="cascaded-pyramid-network-2018">Cascaded Pyramid Network (2018)</h3>
<p>The Cascaded Pyramid Network (CPN) [6] is a network structure which targets to relieve the problem of pose estimation from especially hard-to-predict keypoints which include occluded and invisible ones as well as complex backgrounds and crowded scenes. The authors name two reasons for the difficulty. First the “harder” to detect joints cannot be simply recognized based on their appearance features only (e.g. the torso point). Second they are not explicitly addressed during the training process. Therefore this new algorithm includes two stages: GlobalNet and RefineNet (Figure 23).</p>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/imgs/human_pose_estimation/cpn_architecture.png#center"
         alt="CPN architecture" width="100%"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 23. CPN architecture [6]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is a top-down approach incorporating a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) [21] as human detection model. The ROIPooling in FPN is replaced with ROIAlign from Mask-RCNN [12] and trained on all COCO categories first. The GlobalNet structure is based on the ResNet backbone. 3x3 convolutional filters are applied on the feature maps outputted by the residual blocks 2 to 5 to generate heatmaps for keypoints. The basic idea is the same as in FPN, that the shallower feature maps contain the high spatial resolution for localization but low semantic information for recognition. On the other hand the feature maps produced by deeper layers have more semantic and less spatial resolution. Figure 24 shows the output heatmaps of both the GlobalNet and RefineNet.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/imgs/human_pose_estimation/cpn_output.png#center"

            <p>Figure 24. CPN output heatmaps [6]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see GlobalNet is able to effectively locate the “easier” keypoints like eyes but struggles with the “harder” ones. To improve the performance on harder keypoints RefineNet is attached to GlobalNet. It transmits the information across different levels and integrates them via upsampling and concatenation. The hard keypoints are explicitly selected based on the training loss (called <em>online hard keypoints mining</em>) and their gradients are backpropagated. Figure 24 shows the results of the proposed approach on the COCO test-dev dataset where the “+” sign indicates results using ensembled models. Each human detection box is extended to a fixed aspect ratio, e.g. height : width = 256 : 192 and then cropped from the image without distorting the images aspect ratio. Moreover data augmentation is important for the learning of scale- and rotation-invariance. After the cropping, random flipping, random rotation ($-45^\circ \sim +45^\circ$) and random scaling ($0.7 \sim 1.35$) are applied. For more detailed information about the training procedure, ablation studies and the results you should take a look at the original paper.</p>

<p>OpenPose [4] is the first open-source realtime system for bottom-up multi-person 2D pose estimation and it’s one of the most popular frameworks out there (OpenCV included it). One of the main problems of top-down approaches in HPE is their early commitment, which means that if the person detector fails (this is often the case when people are in close proximity) there is no recourse to recovery. Another problem is the computational complexity and the runtime which is proportional to the number of people in the image. OpenPose works bottom-up, like DeeperCut, but much much faster. Figure 25 illustrates the whole pipeline of this approach.</p>

<p>It takes as input an image of size $w \times h$ and produces the 2D locations of anatomical keypoints for each human in the image. In the first step, a convolutional neural network predicts a set of 2D confidence maps (heatmaps) $\mathbf{S}$ of body part locations (Figure 25 (b)) and a set of 2D vector fields $\mathbf{L}$ called part affinity fields (PAFs). These encode the degree of association between parts (Figure 25 (c)). The set $\mathbf{S} = ( \mathbf{S}_{1}, \mathbf{S}_{2}, \dots , \mathbf{S}_{J} )$ has $J$ confidence maps., one per part, where $\mathbf{S}_{J} \in \mathbb{R}^{w \times h}$ , $j \in {1,\dots,J}$. The set $\mathbf{L} = (\mathbf{L}_{1}, \mathbf{L}_{2}, \dots, \mathbf{L}_{C} )$ has $C$ vector fields, one per limb, where $\mathbf{L}_{c} \in \mathbb{R}^{w \times h \times 2}$ , $c \in {1,\dots,C}$. In this context limbs are part pairs. Then a parsing step creates a set of bipartite matchings to associate the body part candidates. Finally the candidates are assembled into full body poses. Figure 26 shows the architecture of the model, which iteratively predicts affinity fields (blue) and detection confidence maps (beige). The predictions are refined over the successive stages $t \in {1,\dots,T}$ including intermediate supervision at each stage similar to the Convolutional Pose Machines approach.</p>

<p>Before the image is fed to the first stage it gets transformed in a set of feature maps $\mathbf{F}$ by the first 10 layers of a pretrained and finetuned VGG19 network. Based on these maps the first stage produces a set of PAFs $\mathbf{L}_{1} = \phi^{1}(\mathbf{F})$ where $\phi^{1}$ refers to the operations in stage 1. In each subsequent stage the predictions from the previous stage and the original image features $\mathbf{F}$ are concatenated and used to produce refined predictions,</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{L}^{t}=\phi^{t}(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{L}^{t-1}), \forall 2 \leq t \leq T_{p},$$</p>
<p>where $t$ denotes the stage and $T_{p}$ refers to the total number of PAF stages. After $T_{p}$ iterations the process is repeated for the confidence maps detection,</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{S}^{T_{p}}=p^{t}(\mathbf{F},\mathbf{L}^{T_{p}}), \forall t = T_{p}$$</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{S}^{t}=p^{t}(\mathbf{F},\mathbf{L}^{T_{p}}, \mathbf{S}^{t-1}), \forall T_{p} &lt; t \leq T_{p} + T_{c}$$</p>
<p>where $p_t$ refers to the CNNs for inference at stage $t$ and $T_c$ to the number of total confidence map stages. At the end of each stage a $L_{2}$ loss between the estimated predictions and the groundtruth maps and fields is applied. The loss functions are:</p>
<p>$$ f_{\mathbf{L}^t_{i}} = \displaystyle\sum_{c=1}^C \displaystyle\sum_{\mathbf{p}} \mathbf{W} (\mathbf{p}) \cdot \lVert \mathbf{L}^{t_{i}} (\mathbf{p}) - \mathbf{L}^{*}_{c} (\mathbf{p}) \rVert_{2}^{2}$$</p>
<p>$$ f_{\mathbf{S}^{t}_{k}} = \displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{J} \displaystyle\sum_{\mathbf{p}} \mathbf{W}(\mathbf{p}) \cdot | \mathbf{S}_{j}^{t_{k}}(\mathbf{p}) - \mathbf{S}_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{p}) |_{2}^2 $$</p>
<p>where $\mathbf{L}_{c}^{*}$ is the groundtruth PAF, $\mathbf{S}_{j}^{*}$ is the groundtruth part confidence map and $\mathbf{W}$ is a binary mask with $\mathbf{W}(\mathbf{p})=0$ when the annotation of a person or part is missing at the pixel $\mathbf{p}$ (in many datasets not all humans in an image are labelled). The overall objective is:</p>
<p>$$f=\displaystyle \sum_{t=1}^{T_{p}} f_{\mathbf{L}}^{t} + \displaystyle \sum_{t = T_{p} + 1}^{T_{p} + T_{c}} f_{\mathbf{S}}^{t}$$</p>
<p>Now lets take a closer look on how the confidence maps and the PAFs are generated. The confidence maps $\mathbf{S}_{j,k}^{*}$ for each person $k$ and the joint $j$ are defined as</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{S}_{j,k}^{*}(\mathbf{p})=\exp(- \frac{| \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{x}_{j,k} |_{2}^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}),$$</p>
<p>where $x_{j,k}$ is the location of the body part and $\sigma$ controls the spread of the peak. At test time the predicted body part candidates are obtained by performing NMS.
Now lets get to the PAFs. Each of them is a 2D vector field for each limb. For every pixel in the area belonging to a particular limb, a 2D vector encodes the direction that points from one part of the limb to the other. Let $x_{j_{1},k}$ and $x_{j_{2},k}$ be the groundtruth positions of body parts $j_{1}$ and $j_{2}$ from the limb $c$ for person $k$ in the image. If a point $\mathbf{p}$ lies on the limb, the value at $\mathbf{L}^{*}_{c,k}(\mathbf{p})$ is a unit vector that points from $j_{1}$ to $j_{2}$. For all other points the vector is zero valued. The groundtruth PAF $\mathbf{L}^{*}_{c,k}$ at point $\mathbf{p}$ is defined as</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{L}^{*}_{c,k} (\mathbf{p}) =
\begin{cases}
\mathbf{v}      &amp; \quad \text{if } p \text{ on limb } c, k\
0  &amp; \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$</p>
<p>where $\mathbf{v} = (x_{j_{2},k} - x_{j_{1},k}) / | x_{j_{2},k} - x_{j_{1},k} |_{2}$ is the unit vector in the direction of the limb. So now, how do you define the set of points which lie on the limb? This is accomplished by a distance threshold of the line segment, e.g. those points $\mathbf{p}$ for which</p>
<p>$$0 \leq \mathbf{v} \cdot (\mathbf{p} - x_{j_{1},k}) \leq l_{c,k} \text{and} | \mathbf{v}_{\bot} \cdot (\mathbf{p} - x_{j_{1},k}) | \leq \sigma_{l},$$</p>
<p>where the limb width $\sigma_{l}$ is a distance in pixel, $l_{c,k} =  | x_{j_{2},k} - x_{j_{1},k} |_{2}$ is the limb length and $\mathbf{v}_{\bot}$ is a vector perpendicular to $\mathbf{v}$. The groundtruth PAF averages the affinity fields of all people in the image,</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{L}^{*}(\mathbf{p}) = \frac{1}{n_{c}(\mathbf{p})} \displaystyle \sum_{k} \mathbf{L}_{c,k}^{*} (\mathbf{p})$$</p>
<p>where $n_c(\mathbf{p})$ is the number of non-zero vectors at point $\mathbf{p}$ across all people. The association between part candidates is measured by computing the line integral over the corresponding PAF along the line segment connecting the candidate part locations. This measures the aligment of the predicted PAF with the candidate limb that would be formed. For two candidate part locations $\mathbf{d}_{j_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{d}_{j_{2}}$, the predicted PAF $L_{c}$ gets sampled along the line segment to measure the confidence in their association:</p>
<p>$$E= \int_{u=0}^{u=1} \mathbf{L}_{c}(\mathbf{p}(u)) \cdot \frac{\mathbf{d}_{j_{2}} - \mathbf{d}_{j_{1}}}{ | \mathbf{d}_{j_{2}} - \mathbf{d}_{j_{1}} |_{2}} du,$$</p>
<p>where $p(u)$ interpolates the position of the two body parts $\mathbf{d}_{j_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{d}_{j_{2}}$,</p>
<p>$$\mathbf{p}(u) = (1-u) \mathbf{d}_{j_{1}} + u \mathbf{d}_{j_{2}}$$</p>
<p>To obtain a discrete set of part candidate locations NMS on the confidence maps is performed, which form a large set of possible limbs. Each limb candidate is scored by the line integral described before. The resulting $K-dim$ matching problem is known to be NP-hard but in the special case of HPE two relaxations can be added. First, instead of the whole graph a minimal number of edges to obtain a spanning tree skeleton can be chosen. Second, the matching problem can be decomposed into a set of bipartite matching subproblems. The authors demonstrate that a minimal greedy inference well-approximates the global solution at a fraction of the computational cost.</p>

<p>The method is evaluated on three MPPE datasets: MPII multi-person, COCO and a self created foot dataset. Figure 27 shows the results on the COCO test-dev set based on the OKS evaluation metric. One of the main strengths of this approach, in comparison to top-down approaches, is its inference runtime which is independent from the number of people per image. Figure 28 illustrates its superior performance in this regard. This realtime capability is also very important for many real-world applications and one of the reasons why this approach is very well known.</p>

<h3 id="hrnet-2019">HRNet (2019)</h3>
<p>In [33] the authors present a novel model architecture for SPPE, called <em>High-Resolution Net</em> (HRNet) which is able to maintain high-resolution representations through the estimation process. Figure 29 illustrates the architecture of this approach. It consists of parallel high-to-low resolution subnetworks starting from a high-resolution subnetwork. Gradually high-to-low resolution subnetworks are added to form more stages. These multi-resolution subnetworks are connected in parallel. Multi-scale fusions processes are carried out to enable the information exchange across these parallel subnetworks.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">

         alt="Architecture of HRNet" width="70%"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 29. Architecture of HRNet [33]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The two main benefits of this approach in comparison to existing methods are a higher spatial precision due to the maintenance of high resolution (instead of recovering of high from low resolution) and the parallelization instead of serialization. Moreover the network outputs more accurate heatmaps because of the repeated multi-scale fusions. Now lets take a closer look at the details.
The goal is to detect the locations of $K$ keypoints in an image $\mathbf{I}$ of size $W \times H \times 3$. The problem is transformed to an estimation of $K$ heatmaps of size $W^{\prime} \times H^{\prime}, { \mathbf{H}_{1}, \mathbf{H}_{2} ,&hellip; , \mathbf{H}_{K}}$ where each heatmap $\mathbf{H}_{k}$ indicates the location confidence of the $k$th keypoint. The HRNet model is composed of a stem consisting of two strided convolutions decreasing the resolution to $1/4$ of the input size (input: 384x288 to output: 96x72; or input: 256x192 to output: 64x48). The main body which is displayed in Figure 29 outputs the feature maps in the same resolution as the inputs. It consists of parallel multi-resolution subnetworks at different stages. Let $\mathcal{N}_{sr}$ be the subnetwork in the $s$th stage and $r$ be the resolution index, this is an example containing 4 parallel subnetworks</p>
<p>$$\begin{matrix}
\mathcal{N}_{11} &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathcal{N}_{21} &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathcal{N}_{31} &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathcal{N}_{41} \newline
&amp; \searrow &amp; \mathcal{N}_{22} &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathcal{N}_{32} &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathcal{N}_{42} \newline
&amp; &amp; &amp; \searrow &amp; \mathcal{N}_{33} &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathcal{N}_{43} \newline
&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \searrow &amp; \mathcal{N}_{44}
\end{matrix}$$</p>
<p>As you can see in Figure 29, the subnetworks are connected to each other in parallel through so called <em>exchange units</em> which aggregate the information from high, medium and low resolutions (HRNet has 8 of them in total). The authors call this process repeated multi-scale fusion which is illustrated in Figure 30.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/imgs/human_pose_estimation/hrnet_exchange_units.png#center"
         alt="HRNet exchange units" width="60%"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 30. HRNet exchange units [33]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Lets look at the formulation of these exchange units a bit closer. The inputs are $s$ response maps: ${\mathbf{X}_{1}, \mathbf{X}_{2}, &hellip; , \mathbf{X}_{s}}$. The outputs are also $s$ response maps: ${\mathbf{Y}_{1}, \mathbf{Y}_{2}, &hellip; , \mathbf{Y}_{s}}$ whose resolutions and widths are the same to the input. Each output is an aggregation of the input maps $\mathbf{Y}_{k} = \sum_{i=1}^{s} a(\mathbf{X}_{i}, k)$. The function $a(\mathbf{X}_{i}, k)$ consists of upsampling (nearest neighbor sampling + 1x1 convolution) or downsampling (strided 3x3 convolution) $\mathbf{X}_{i}$ from resolution $i$ to resolution $k$. The heatmap estimation is done based on the high-resolution output by the last exchange unit. The groundtruth heatmaps are generated through 2D Gaussian with a standard deviation of 1 pixel centered on the location of the keypoint. The loss function applied on the heatmaps is Mean Squared Error. Since HRNet is a top-down model for SPPE, the authors used groundtruth bounding box labels in the training process without a separate detection model. The bounding box is extended in height or width to a fixed aspect ratio of height : width = 4 : 3 and then the box is cropped from the image and resized (256 x 192 or 384 x 288). The data augmentation includes random rotation, random scale and flipping. For more details on the training process take a look at the paper (it’s very well written in my opinion). Figure 31 shows the results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art models on the CODO test-dev set. In addition the authors tested the model on MPII and PoseTrack.</p>

<h3 id="efficientpose-2020">EfficientPose (2020)</h3>
<p>One of the main problems of state-of-the-art models is their high degree computational complexity which makes them cumbersome to optimize, hard to replicate and impractical to embed into real-world applications. Because of this a novel approach for single-person pose estimation from 2D images called EfficientPose [11] was introduced. The authors compare this to OpenPose because this model is one of the most applied HPE methods in real-world applications and the first open-source real-time HPE system. The problems with OpenPose are its low resolution output (46x46px) and the computational expense (160 billion floating point operations per inference). To overcome these shortcomings the EfficientPose architecture is based on OpenPose including many important modifications to improve the level of precision, decrease computational cost and model size.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/imgs/human_pose_estimation/efficientpose_architecture.png#center"
         alt="EfficientPose architecture" width="100%"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 32. EfficientPose architecture [11]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The first modification are two inputs, one high- and one low-resolution image (Figure 32 - 1a) and 1b)). The low resolution input is downsampled to half the pixel height and width of the high resolution input by an initial average pooling layer. Both inputs are fed into scalable EfficientNet backbones, pretrained on ImageNet, which are used as feature extractors. High-level semantic information is obtained from the high resolution image using the initial three blocks of a high-scale EfficientNet (B2-B7) which outputs C feature maps. Low-level information is extracted from the low resolution image by the first two blocks of a lower scale EfficientNet (B0-B3). For detailed information on the structure of the before mentioned EfficientNet blocks take a look at the paper. After that the extracted low- and high-level features are concatenated to yield cross-resolution features. The keypoint localization is carried out through an iterative detection process exploiting intermediate supervision. The iterative decision process consists of three passes through detection blocks which all have the same basic structure (Mobile DenseNets). Detailed information on the architecture of these detection blocks can be found in the paper. The detection is carried out in two rounds. First the overall pose is anticipated through a single pass of skeleton estimation (Figure 32 - 5a). The goal of this first pass is to facilitate detection of feasible poses and to avoid confusion if there are multiple people present in an image. Part Affinity Fields are utilized when performing skeleton estimation. Following this step, two detection passes are carried out to estimate heatmaps for keypoints of interest. The former pass acts as a coarse detector (Figure 32 - 5b) while the second one (Figure 32 - 5c) refines localization to improve the accuracy of the outputs. In the sixth and last step the level of detail of the outputs is increased by three transposed convolutions (each of them increases the map size by a factor of two) performing bilinear upsampling.</p>

</figure>

<p>Five different variants of EfficientPose models are presented, details in Figure 33. EfficientPoseRT is a single-resolution model, matching the scale of the smallest EfficientNet model, providing HPE in extremely low latency applications. The evaluation of the models is based on MPII single-person dataset (train-val-split: 26K, 3K). During training the authors use data augmentation (random horizontal flipping, scaling, rotation). For evaluation the PCKh metric is calculated and compared to OpenPose and other models. In Figure 34 the results in comparison to OpenPose are displayed.</p>

</figure>

<p>The presented approach is 4-5.6x smaller than OpenPose regarding the model size (number of parameters) and realizes a 2.2 - 184x reduction in FLOPS. In addition to that the new approach converges faster. The comparison here was between EfficientPoseII and OpenPose because of the similar input size. Potentially the model can also be interesting for multi-person-pose-estimation in a bottom-up fashion based on Part Affinity Fields like OpenPose.</p>
<h3 id="evopose2d-2020">EvoPose2D (2020)</h3>
<p>EvoPose2D [24] is the first SPPE network design based on neuroevolution, which is a form of neural architecture search (NAS). The main benefit of networks designed this way is the elimination of human bias leading to more accurate and computationally efficient models. The authors also present a new flexible weight transfer scheme in combination with large-batch (up to 2048 256x192 images) training on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that reduces the computational expense of neuroevolution and has no loss in accuracy. For detailed information on neuroevolution take a look at [29]. In this case it is used because of its simplicity compared to alternative approaches based on reinforcement learning, one-shot or gradient-based NAS.</p>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/imgs/human_pose_estimation/evopose_weight_transfer.png#center"
         alt="Weight transfer scheme" width="70%"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 35. Weight transfer scheme [24]</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Figure 35 illustrates the weight transfer scheme pretty well. $W^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{k_{p1} \times k_{p2} \times i_{p} \times o_{p}}$ are the weights of layer $l$ used by the parent network and $V^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{k_{c1} \times k_{c2} \times i_{c} \times o_{c}}$ denote the weights of the mutated child network where $k$ is the kernel size, $i$ is the number of input channels and $o$ is the number of output channels. Figure 35 shows two examples ($W \to V_{1}, W \to V_{2}$) of this weight transfer process. The trained weights (shown in blue) in the parent convolutional filter $W$ are transferred, either in part or in full to the corresponding filter $V$ in the mutated child network. The weight transfer extends to all output channels in the same manner as depicted here for the input channels. As a result the mutated network can be trained using fewer iterations which accelerates the neuroevolution.
But keep in mind NAS is far from perfect and you as a human have to design and limit the search space carefully. The starting point in this work was the Simple-Baseline [38] architecture. For each module the authors searched for the optimal kernel size, number of inverted residual blocks, output channels and in the last three modules they additionally searched for the optimal stride (the resulting search space can produce $10^{14}$ unique backbones).
A multi-objective fitness function was applied to create a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy including the validation loss and the number of network parameters. The fitness of the network $\mathcal{N}$ can be defined as:</p>
<p>$$\mathcal{J}(\mathcal{N}) = \left(\frac{T}{n(\theta^{\mathcal{N}})}\right)^{\Gamma} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathcal{L} (\mathcal{N}, \mathbf{I}_{i})$$</p>
<p>where $N$ is the number of samples in the validation set, $\mathbf{I}$ is the input image, $n(\theta^{\mathcal{N}})$ is the number of parameters in $\mathcal{N}$, $T$ is the target number of parameters and $\Gamma$ controls the fitness tradeoff between the number of parameters and the validation loss $\mathcal{L} (\mathcal{N}, \mathbf{I}_{i})$. Now lets take a look at the evolutionary strategy. The first generation is a manually defined model and trained for $e_{0}$ epochs. In the next generation $\lambda$ children are generated by mutating the ancestor network (including weight transfer) and then trained for $e$ epochs ($e \ll e_{0}$). After training, the $\mu$ networks with the best fitness become the parents in the next generation and so on. This process continues until manual termination. Motivated by the success of compound scaling (like in EfficientNet) the authors also scaled the base network to different input resolutions using the following depth ($c_{d}$) and width ($c_{w}$) coefficients:</p>
<p>$$c_{d} = \alpha^{\phi} \quad c_{w} = \beta^{\phi} \quad \phi = \frac{\log r - \log r_{s}}{\log \gamma}$$</p>
<p>where $r_{s}$ is the search resolution, $r$ is the desired resolution and $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ are scaling parameters.</p>

<p>Figure 36 shows the architecture of the second smallest version of the EvoPose2D models, called EvoPose2D-S, designed via neuroevolution. With an input width and height of $256 \times 192$ and $17$ keypoints to predict, it only contains $2.53M$ parameters and $1.07$ GFLOPs. It has a performance on COCO similar to Simple-Baseline (ResNet50) which has $34.1M$ parameters and $5.21$ GFLOPs. The evaluation of the models was done on the COCO keypoints 2017 dataset. As you can see in Figure 37 the EvoPose2D models have up to 13.5 times less parameters, the performance is similar to state-of-the-art architectures like HRNet-W48 and the input resolution is higher.</p>
