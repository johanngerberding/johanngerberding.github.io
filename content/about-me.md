Hello everybody, my name is Johann, I am a Machine Learning Engineer from Germany working for a startup called JustAddAI.  

{{< figure align=center alt="picture of Johann Gerberding" src="/imgs/johann.jpeg" width=70% >}}

I am a kind of self-taught developer who considers himself still pretty much at the beginning (noob). However, I still have a lot to learn but really enjoy the process of researching new things and am currently trying to dive deeper into the world of LLMs. To be honest, I am much more impressed about the stuff Tesla, comma.ai and wayve.ai are doing in the world of autonomous robotics/world modeling than by LLMs but I think it's pretty useful to still learn how those things work ;). 

I use my blog as a kind of learning diary in which I occasionally write short blog posts on topics related to machine learning, algorithms or other cool stuff in which I am interested or currently working on. 

In my spare time I enjoy reading a book or doing sports, especially calisthenics. If you want to know more about me, get in touch with me, have questions or find any errors here, feel free to have a look at my contact information down below or simply send me an [E-Mail](<johann.gerberding@gmail.com>).
