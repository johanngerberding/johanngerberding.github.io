## Introduction

<p align="justify">
I think I heard the term World Model one or two years ago, when some person from <a href="">comma.ai</a> mentioned it, maybe it was in one of George's streams. I knew about the paper from comma that they published in 2016, talking about similar stuff just they used other terms.
